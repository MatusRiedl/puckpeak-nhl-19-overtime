"""What the controller needs from the window: pushes of state to the page, the details log, one-off events.

The controller marks a slice of state as changed; two threads send what changed, each at most 25 times a second
(the newest state wins, log lines are sent together). The quick one sends the status line, the Question, the log
lines and the events: none of their snapshots takes the controller's lock, so the Help bar moves while a job holds
it. The other sends the tabs' slices. A message goes through a transport: pywebview's evaluate_js in the window, or
the local server's event stream in browser mode. The status slice comes first in every message.

`picker` (set by window/main.py in the window) shows Windows' file and folder pickers; browser mode has none.
