"""The page's Python side in one table: which part owns which slice and which call.

Each part is a class in its own module (one per tab, plus the shell and the rail), made once with the Controller.
It declares its whole page interface in one place, at the top of the class:

    SLICES = {'lines': 'view'}           slice name -> the method that builds it (plain data, ready to send)
    CALLS = {'lines_slot': 'slot', ...}  call name -> the method the page's call runs; None: not built yet
    TAB = 'lines'                        the tab it draws (the rail's followers: follow, hide, roster_changed)

attach(ctl) makes every part (ctl.parts[key]), registers its slices with the host and returns {call: function}:
what window/api.py dispatches to (its EXPOSED is calls() plus 'ready'). A call not built yet answers
{'error': 'not built yet'} and says so on the Help bar; every slice the page reads is registered from the start, with
a minimal shape the page can draw.

A new part: its module in PARTS and in part_classes' import (written out: PyInstaller finds only imports it can read).
