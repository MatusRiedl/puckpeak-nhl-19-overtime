"""Game patch: what the Overtime patch puts into NHL 19 (its switches), what is in the game now, and what the patch
does. docs/ui/patch.md.

The switches are beta1's patch_want (kept in the settings). Patch is the one click (one_click): the data overlay
with exactly the switches that are on, the eboot patch with the Overtime server address and the network settings
(gamesetup), then a look at what is in the game now. Unpatch (one_unpatch) takes both away. The page calls Setup's names for them (setup_patch / setup_unpatch, which re/scripts/oneclick_run.py
drives on a SetupController of its own), so the one click is a function of the SetupController here: Setup's calls run
it, and this tab's patch_apply / patch_undo (beta1's names) are the same two. The game folder is only ever read: the
patch is served from the overlay folder beside it (overtime_core.overlay).
