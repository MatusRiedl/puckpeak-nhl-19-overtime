"""Reading the organisations' contracts from the open roster for the Front office tab (office_ctl), read only.
docs/ui/office.md, "How Python reads one organisation".

An organisation is an NHL club (the rail's id; Seattle 399, whose players are on the custom team 499) with three
groups of exhibitionplayerbiotable rows (game_id < rosterupdate.SPECIAL_IDS):

    nhl         the bios on the club with a deal (contractstatus 0); only these count toward the cap
    farm        the AHL club that holds most of the organisation's other players (`proteam`; exhibitionteams'
                ahlaffiliate is stale for six clubs in the default roster), and those players on it
    prospects   the organisation's other `proteam` bios (rights, juniors, Europe, free agents)

Money is in dollars (contractdollars and extensiondollars x labels.CONTRACT_UNIT) and comes out as text: $12.5M,
$850K. The cap and the lowest payroll are the league layer's (overlay.CAP_2026 / ROWS_2026) when Game patch serves
it, else NHL 19's own (CAP_STOCK / ROWS_STOCK). Years are the seasons a deal has left: a roster that carries the
expansion career's extra season (rosterupdate.expansion_contracts: contractlength + 1, the patch's default roster,
the online roster, an Update with NHL 27) shows one less; such a roster is known by having no one-season NHL deal at all.
