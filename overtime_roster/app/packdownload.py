"""The picture packs the exe does not carry (beta2, the owner's decision of 2026-10-21, like Legacy's packs.py): NHL 27
looks of all 32 teams, Utah's and Seattle's whole look, NHL.com player photos and the all-team 3D kits (PACKS). They
are published on the release host next to latest.json (selfupdate; uploaded by the maintainer,
overtime_server/http/appupdate.py) and downloaded into the app's cache folder, the first place the art layer looks
(patch.art_places): the Photos, logos pack card on Game patch fetches all four at once (v0.10.0: the patch never
downloads; missing_core is the selftest's list). Standard library only.

latest.json names each pack, its sha256 and size:
    "packs": {"photos.zip": {"file": "packs/photos.zip", "sha256": "...", "size": 24117600}, ...}
("file" defaults to packs/<name>, relative to latest.json; without "sha256" the pack's line in SHA256SUMS.txt gives
it, and when both are there they must agree). A file that is not the one published is deleted, never used.

photos.zip is p<artid>.gnf of the default roster's bios (tools/build_photopack.py --database), so it is used only when
every portrait is on a bio of the default roster the app serves (defaultdb's verified default; packaging/
check_photos.py runs the same check at build time). One made for another roster (an older or newer exe's) is deleted
and remembered, so it is not downloaded again for this roster.

What is in the cache is remembered in <cache>/packs.json ({name: {sha256, size, mtime}}, photos.zip also {roster,
fits}; WRONG: the photos made for another roster), so a status does not hash a hundred megabytes each time.
