"""The game patch from the app's side (Patch tab, tools/game_patch.py): the data overlay (overtime_core.overlay) and
the default roster brought up to 2026-27 for its database layer.

The database layer is the game's own default roster (nhl_game.db) after the same update the Update tab makes:
NHL.com rosters, Utah, Seattle, ratings, lines and the real calendar. With it in the patch, every mode that starts
from the default roster sees the 2026-27 league without loading a custom roster, Seattle filled and active. Only the
expansion career's start roster (overlay.mode_roster_files: expansion_draft.db) has Seattle empty, so the expansion
draft builds the team; that career takes its free agents from this database, so Seattle's players are on its free
agent list too (rosterupdate.expansion_free_agents; other modes do not list a rostered player).

The art layer serves the art packs found (ART_PACKS: NHL 27's team art; built on the owner's PC by tools/build_looks.py,
never committed): switch ART_SWITCH. The exe carries the all-team logos / menus / centre ice and Utah's and Seattle's
whole look; the all-team 3D kits are a delta pack downloaded on request (KITS_PACK, switch `kits`; overtime_roster.
app.packdownload). NHL.com portraits (PHOTOS_PACK, built by tools/build_photopack.py) are keyed by the served bios'
art ids, and the overlay's database step sets each bio's portrait flag from the art served (art.portrait_flags).
