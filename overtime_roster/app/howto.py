This folder holds one NHL 19 custom roster save, {folder_name}, for shadPS4. Nothing was changed on the PC that made it.

1. Close shadPS4.
2. Find shadPS4's user data folder on the PC that runs the game:
{where}
  If you start shadPS4 with a "user" folder next to where you launch it, that folder is the one.
3. Copy the folder
     {DATA_DIR}/{'/'.join(SAVE_PARTS)}/{folder_name}
   into
     <user data folder>/{'/'.join(SAVE_PARTS)}/
   If {folder_name} is already there, do not copy over it (that would replace a roster you may want) and do not
   rename the folder: a renamed copy shows in the game's list but does not load. Make the folder again in
   Overtime Roster with "Slot on the other PC" set to a slot that is free there (RosterCustom0 to RosterCustom14).
4. Start NHL 19. In Rosters > Active Roster, pick "Custom Roster {slot}" (the number follows the folder name,
   RosterCustom0 is Custom Roster 1).

The game lists RosterCustom0 to RosterCustom14 only.
