"""The game's calendar: a real NHL season written into a roster's schedule tables (idea from PS3 Legacy `schedule.py`).

Every schedule table has the fields round, day, month, index, home, away: one row per game, `month` 0 = January,
`day` 0 = the 1st (stock row 0 of nhlschedule is TOR-MTL on day 2 of month 9: the real 2018-19 opener, 3 Oct 2018),
`index` the row's own number, `home` / `away` team indexes. No year and no time of day. Rows are sorted by date.

    nhl32schedule        the calendar of a Franchise with the 32-team expansion (run X1: the league's regular season is
                         this table's games): places 0-31 (`SLOTS32`). Each place plays its row's games and keeps its
                         stock division, and the league layer's realignment lists Seattle (customteams 499) in Utah's
                         Pacific place 22 and Utah in place 31 (run v0100-s3b), so place 22 gets Seattle's games. Stock
                         1,312 rows (32 x 82), room 1,372: the real season's 1,344 games (32 x 84) fit (Franchise
                         played 84 per team, run X1; Play Now with this table at 84 plays, ws8-20261018/run1q).
    nhlschedule, nhlfutureschedule, favoriteteamschedule
                         the 31-team calendars (Season, Classic Franchise, Be a Pro; stock: three equal copies, 31 x 82):
                         teams 0-30. They get the real season with Seattle's games folded into games between its
                         opponents (`fold`), cut to 82 per team.

The 31-team tables keep the stock 82 games per team, 41 at home; the 32-team nhl32schedule has 84. The
Play Now crash once blamed on 80 games (0xc0000005, ws8-20261018/run1c..1p) came from the roster, not the calendar
(see docs/notes/nhl19-32teams-re.md). `GAMES` is their default.

All the tables are in the `rosters` and `rosterupdate` savegroups: the calendar travels in a custom roster save and
in the online roster.
