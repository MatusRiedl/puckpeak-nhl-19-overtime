"""Auto lines: deal all 87 line slots of a team from scratch, by rating and position (idea from PS3 Legacy `lines.py`).

Used for teams whose players changed (the Update pipeline) and for teams the game left without lines (Seattle). The
rules are what every NHL team of the game's default roster satisfies (tests/test_lines.py):
  * 20 players dress (exhibitionrostertable.rosterstatus 1): 12 forwards on four lines, 6 defencemen in three pairs,
    2 goalies; the others 0;
  * each of the 87 slots has exactly one holder, goalies only goalie slots;
  * only dressed players hold slots, except NHL Threes' (the mode picks its own team: 9 stock holders do not dress);
  * inside one group of units (power play, penalty kill, overtime, Threes, ...) a player holds one slot at most (the
    seven Threes slots are seven players).
Slots: even strength l1-l4 (lw c rw), l1-l3 (ld rd), g1 g2; power play pp1 pp2 (lw c rw ld rd), pp4_1 pp4_2 (lw c ld rd);
penalty kill pk4_1 pk4_2 (lw c ld rd), pk3_1 pk3_2 (c ld rd); overtime ot_1-3 (lw c ld rd), 3-on-3 ot3_1-3 (c ld rd);
shootout s1-s5; extra attackers x1 x2; NHL Threes three_c three_w three_d three_g1 three_g2 three_s1 three_s2.

The Lines tab edits one slot at a time (`place`, Legacy's swap rules), re-deals one group of units (`deal_groups`)
and lists what the game would refuse (`check_lineup`).
