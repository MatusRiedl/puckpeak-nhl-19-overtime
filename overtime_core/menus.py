"""The hub without the modes that died with EA's servers: Hockey Ultimate Team, Draft Champions and World of Chel;
the news tile shows the Puck Peak line (or goes, with `news` off). The overlay's menus layer (overtime_core.overlay)
serves boot.big with these two files changed:

  homepage.lua     ProcessHomepageTilesData builds self.MODES (every hub tile, l.~900-1243), then the grid and the
                   pinned row from it. Right before that, the three modes leave self.MODES (and the featured-tile
                   list), so neither the grid nor the pinned row nor the featured tile can show them. The grid is
                   6 columns x 3 rows in self.MODES order (row by row), and the three are exactly its ONLINE column,
                   so with them gone it is 5 columns with every other tile under its own title. The ONLINE title
                   leaves o.TITLES the same way. With World of Chel on (`chel`), its tile takes the EA SPORTS ad
                   tile's place (EXTRAS, last row) instead.
                   The featured tile is looked up by FeatureId in self.MODES; a featured mode that is gone would
                   index self.MODES[-1] (a Lua error), so the first tile (Play Now) is featured instead.
                   The pinned row's last tile is the news tile (IDENTIFIER.DYNAMIC_MESSAGE: EA's dynamic messages,
                   without a server the default TXT_DEFAULT_MESSAGE_HOME_1, which the text pack makes the Puck Peak
                   line "Updates, patches, statistics! Join us on gg.puckpeak.com"). It stays (`news`, on by
                   default, owner 2026-10-23). With `news` off its place becomes an EMPTY tile: the row keeps its 5
                   positions (pin, unpin and the featured tile work by position) and the cursor skips EMPTY.
  homepage.layout  the grid's PositionItemsInGrid numSections 6 -> 5.

Zero-press launch (`launch`, docs/plans/m2-zero-press.md): not an option, never served or recorded as one. With
`{'until': <unix seconds>}` the two files above gain one hook each and hub.lua is served too:

  homepage.lua     at the end of ProcessHomepageTilesData, once per process, while os.time() <= until: the Online Versus
                   tile's own nav event (what `_OnAdvanceAction` sends), flag `_G.OvertimeAutoplay = 'home'`.
  hub.lua          (online hub) at the end of Hub:PublishData, when the hub is the Online Versus one and both data
                   sources are in and the flag is 'home': `_OnAdvance(PLAYNOW_ONLINE)` (PLAY), flag 'hub'.
`{'rules': {...}}` (overtime_core.rules; only with a launch) also serves the Online Versus rules file with those rules'
`defaultvalue`s set, so the game searches with them (docs/plans/m3b-match-settings.md). It goes off with the hook.
Every hook body is a pcall: a Lua error (an `os` that is not reachable, a missing global) leaves the screen as it was,
and a stale hook (the window passed) does nothing. `diag` writes the clock and the flag into the grid's last column
title (a lab aid: it shows whether `os.time()` works and which clock it reads).

Nothing here knows offsets: each edit has an anchor that must be in the player's own file exactly once, and a
file that does not look as expected is refused (MenuError). Line ends stay CRLF. Modes are never removed on the
server's side (the hub crashes without them, docs/notes/hub-config.md).
