"""Today's NHL in an NHL 19 roster: NHL.com rosters, EA ratings, the 2026-27 teams and the real calendar (idea from PS3
Legacy's update pipeline, `pipeline.py` / `builder.py`).

    gather_rosters(client, season)   NHL.com: every club's roster, flattened (nhlcom.roster_players)
    plan(db, real)                   who stays, moves, is new or leaves (nothing written)
    apply(db, schema, plan, ...)     do it, then Utah / Seattle, lines, ratings, calendar; returns a Report

Players. NHL.com players are matched to the roster's players by name and birth date (matching.py). A matched player on
another team (or a free agent, or in another league) moves: his roster row leaves its team and is put back at the end
of his new team's rows. The game keeps exhibitionrostertable sorted by team and by `key`: rows are written back in
that order, a new row gets the key after the row before it, and later keys move up only where there is no gap.
A real player with no match is made from a donor of the same position with a generic face: new bio, ratings,
equipment and exhibitionplayers records after the last ones (those tables are sorted by game_id / index).
Players of an NHL team who are on no real roster become free agents (bio team -1); NHL.com's rosters leave out injured
players, so the best of them stay while their team would not have 18 skaters and 2 goalies to dress.
Seattle's players go to customrostertable, team 499 (the expansion team, teams.py); Arizona's slot is Utah's.
exhibitionteams 399 (Seattle in Play Now and the online roster) gets the same players through their own
exhibitionplayers records (mirror_seattle).

All-Star teams (31-34) keep their rows (they point at players through their own exhibitionplayers records).
